# Problem Statement :  
Write the Verilog code (.v) of an **8-bit ALU** that can execute following four different operations:  
a. Addition  
b. Multiplication  
c. AND  
d. XOR  
  
  
For further information, refer '*Report File.pdf*'
  
#NOTE : 
The coding is done is **Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.7 (WebPack)**.

For downloading the software (6.17GB), you can choose the following in the link opened:<br/>
*Student â€“ ISE required for classes<br/>
*WebPACK<br/>
*Spartan-3E/-3A/-3AN<br/>
*This is the first time<br/>
 
Just follow the steps to install the WebPACK from this design suite. There is no need to download licence file for the use of this software, as you will only simulate your Verilog code (no need to synthesis the design).
